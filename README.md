Last Updated (updated)
========
The Last updated module displays information about the last time a node was updated as an addendum to node creation information.  Post-activation, node update information is always available in the Administrative GUI, and can optionally be made visible in the User GUI.

Last updated functionality must first be activated across a Content type, after which it can be selectively turned on or off on a per Node basis.  More documentation about how to install, activate, configure, administer and use this module is available at:

The Last updated (**updated**) module enables the monitoring of when a node was last updated.  This information is always made available in the Administrative GUI, and can be optionally exposed within the User GUI via settings made present in the Administrative GUI.  Last updated functionality can be applied at the *Content type* level or at the individual Node level.

## Installation
This module does not require a custom installation workflow.  Simply follow the official Backdrop CMS module installation workflow located at:  
https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

## Administrative GUI Visibility
Post-installation, the day, date and time of the last node update always appears as a read-only field in the "Authoring information" section of the node edit form.

## User GUI Visibility
Post-installation, whether or not text representing the day, date and time of the last node update appears in the User GUI is controlled via checkboxes located in the "Publishing options" section of the node edit form.  By way of this mechanism, it is possible to selectively expose node update information down to a node-by-node basis.
